# Google Cloud SDK Ignore File (.gcloudignore)

# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/gcloudignore
#
# This file specifies files and directories that should NOT be uploaded to
# Google Cloud when deploying your application (e.g., via `gcloud app deploy`
# or `gcloud run deploy --source .`). A comprehensive ignore file is crucial for:
#
#   1. Faster Deployments: Prevents uploading unnecessary files.
#   2. Security: Prevents uploading sensitive data like local secrets or credentials.
#   3. Smaller Container Images: Results in a leaner, more efficient application image.
#   4. Avoiding Build Conflicts: Excludes local artifacts that might interfere with
#      the cloud build process.
